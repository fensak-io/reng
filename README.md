This is the source code for the [Fensak](https://fensak.io) Rules Engine which drives execution of user defined rules on
the Fensak platform.


## LICENSE

`SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later OR BUSL-1.1`

`reng` is dual-licensed under the [AGPL 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html) (or any later version) and
[Business Source License 1.1](https://mariadb.com/bsl-faq-adopting/) (with no Additional Use Grant). Refer to the
corresponding LICENSE files for the full parameters of either license:

- [LICENSE.AGPL-3.0-or-later](/LICENSE.AGPL-3.0-or-later)
- [LICENSE.BUSL-1.1](/LICENSE.BUSL-1.1)

Dual licensing means that you can use the code under the terms of **either** license.

For example, if you are using this to test your rules functions and you do not want to be bound by the terms of the AGPL
license (and thus be forced to release the source code of your rules), you can license the `reng` code under the BUSL
1.1 license.

On the other hand, if you wish to use `reng` in an internal-use only or open source service, then you can license `reng`
under the terms of the AGPL 3.0 (or later) license. You can not use `reng` in this manner under the BUSL 1.1 license
since it does not allow any additional use grant for production usage.

Refer to the [License FAQ](https://docs.fensak.io/docs/license-faq/) for more information.
